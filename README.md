# Advanced Algorithms Implementation 

<h2> Course Information </h2>

This project was developed as part of the MYY-602 Artificial Intelligence course in the Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of Ioannina by the students:

    Charalampos Theodoridis - cs04674@uoi.gr
    Ilias Papathanasiou - cs04765@uoi.gr
    Konstantinos Papadopoulos - cs04761@uoi.gr

<h3> Overview </h3>

This project is implemented using Java, emphasizing structured code and object-oriented principles suitable for algorithmic design.

It contains implementations and documentation for two main algorithms in artificial intelligence: pathfinding and game strategy for Connect-4. The project is divided into specific exercises, each addressing different aspects and complexities of algorithm design.

    Connect-4 Game Implementations:
      <h4>  MiniMaxWithOutDepthLimit: </h4> 
            Implementation of the MiniMax algorithm (with Alpha-Beta pruning) without a depth limit. The minimal board dimensions are set to 4 rows and 5 columns to maintain manageable complexity. Terminal states are reached, demonstrating the algorithm's complete execution path. Tips for adjusting board dimensions are included in the source code comments.
      <h4>   MiniMaxWithDepthLimit: </h4> 
            This folder contains the MiniMax algorithm implementation (with Alpha-Beta pruning) using a depth limit. It includes an evaluation function for assessing game states. Recommendations for improving the evaluation function to enhance gameplay are discussed.
